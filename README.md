## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This is the third project from FrontEnd Mentor. This is the first project that required a special background to be applied to the page as well as "box-shadow" property in addition to active states.


### Continued development

In future projects I would like to place more backgrounds in order to practise positioning.
